# Heroku-Database-Example
 REST controls: 
- ('/people') prints the list of all people in the DB
- ('/add/{name}') save the {name} to the DB
- ('/get/{name}') gets a particular person by name from the DB

- You can run this locally by going to commandline and in the project directory calling $gradle run

# Goal
Get a Postgres DB to work for this project.
PS: to run projects on Heroku you'll need a 'Procfile'
